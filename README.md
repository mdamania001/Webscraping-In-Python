In United States, we have states with varied weather conditions. Travellers need to make sure that they check weather conditions at their starting state and  destination state before travelling and this app will helpful for that.

In this project, I have used selenium package in python to showcase a small GUI using chrome driver which we take 2 inputs, your starting point and your ending point. The output will suggest you if it is a good decision travel.

I have used BeautifulSoup to webscrape the data from https://www.weatherbug.com website. The return type was json string. The JSON string is parsed to get information such as Temperature at the destination and source and, weather details.
